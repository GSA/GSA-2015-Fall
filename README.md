# Data Center Consolidation project
## Extracting differences between periods

change_report.pl

Features:

* Given a pair of DataPoint spreadsheets
   * with consistent column names but not necessarily consistent row/column positions
* Produces CSV-formatted data rows indicating the differences between them

Future directions:

* Based on a configurable Cost Factors CSV file, could easily include the dollar-amount deltas between periods.
